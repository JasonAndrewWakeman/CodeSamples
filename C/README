*****All executables of project 1a take in simp files as arguments and expel simp files

DATA STRUCTURES:
*****The data from .simp is stored in this program within a struct named simple with a width and height and a \
-------------2 dimensional array of pixel(s).
*****A pixel is a struct in this program with four unsigned char variables representing red, green, blue, and alpha.

FILES INCLUDED:
*****crop expects a simp file in, a simp file out, the x and y coordinates of where to start cropping, \
------------and the width and length of the area to crop. The outfile is the cropped image.

*****bw expects a simp file in and a simp file out. The outfile is the infile converted to black and white.

*****colorshift expects a simp file in, a simp file out, and a string representing a pattern by which to shift colors. \
------------The expected patterns are {RGB GBR BRG RBG BGR GRB RG GR RB BR GB BG}. The outfile is the infile with its colors\
------------manipulated in the fassion declared by the pattern.

*****overlay expects a simp file in, another simp file in to lay over the first simp file, a simp file out, and \
-----------the x and y coordinate to start the overlay. the outfile is the first infile with the second infile lain \
-----------overtop of it. Depending on the alpha values of the second infile. more or less of its color will prevail.

UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR:
******In bw the bw value of each color in each pigment is rounded down to the largest whole number. 
------------ie if the rgb values are 5 6 6 the average will be 5 (5.67 rounded down to 5 and not 6). 

******If any dimensions are outside of the range of where they are suppose to be all executables \
-----------simply display a message to the output that there was a problem.
